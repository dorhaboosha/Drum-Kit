# Drum Kit

This JavaScript project simulates a virtual drum kit, allowing users to play drums by clicking on images of drum components or pressing keys displayed within the images. 

Each interaction triggers the corresponding drum sound, providing an immersive and interactive drumming experience where users can create music by playing the virtual drum set in real-time.
